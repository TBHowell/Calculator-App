# Calculator-App
This project was the final project for my Applications Programming class and had us utilize certain design techniques we learned throughout. We needed to implement the MVC design practice and utilize a finite state machine in order to optimize our programming as well as practicing this technique. It was certainly interesting to apply many of the lessons we had learned throughout the quarter to create this application. In the end this project turned out well for me and worked just as intended with no outstanding issues.
